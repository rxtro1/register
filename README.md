### NS Records
When applying for NS records, please consider if you *actually* need them.
In your PR, please provide *extensive* reasoning, with evidence/examples, of why you need NS records.
You can see a good example of this [here](https://github.com/is-a-dev/register/pull/17592).

***Pull requests adding NS records without valid reasoning will be closed.***

**Instant Denials**:
- I don't want to create a pull request everytime I want to update my DNS records.
  - Over 3,000 people have to create PRs for updating their records, you can too.
- It is easier to manage DNS records on *(insert DNS provider name)*.
   - It isn't too difficult to open a pull request to update your DNS records. We aim for PRs to be merged with-in 24 hours.
- I want to use DDoS protection.
   - You can simply add `"proxied": true` to your file, to enable Cloudflare's Enterprise-level DDoS protection for your subdomain.

> [!NOTE]
> You can skip these requirements by [supporting the service](https://wdh.gg/pvNCdvs) with a small amount of $2.
